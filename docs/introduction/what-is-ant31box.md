# What is ant31box?

`ant31box` is an asynchronous Python library designed to dramatically accelerate the development of robust, production-ready microservices. It provides a standardized, opinionated foundation that solves common problems like configuration management, server setup, and asynchronous client implementation, allowing developers to focus on business logic instead of boilerplate.

At its core, `ant31box` is built for the modern Python ecosystem (3.12+). It embraces `asyncio` for high-performance I/O, `Pydantic` for type-safe data and configuration, and `FastAPI` for building fast, modern APIs.

The framework emphasizes a modular and structured development approach. Key components include:

-   **Declarative Configuration**: A powerful configuration system that merges settings from YAML files and environment variables into Pydantic models.
-   **Pre-configured FastAPI Server**: A ready-to-use FastAPI server with essential middlewares for metrics, error handling, CORS, and security.
-   **Fully Asynchronous Clients**: Non-blocking clients for S3 and file downloads, built on `aioboto3` and `aiohttp`.
-   **Dependency Injection**: A clean pattern for managing dependencies like configuration, promoting testability and decoupling components.

`ant31box` is ideal for developers and teams looking to build scalable, maintainable, and observable Python services without reinventing the wheel.
